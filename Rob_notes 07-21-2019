Check test..  Check. Microphone working.

Okay, so I have located Joel's GitHub proj for asciargo. I saw a stub for Rob_notes, and so I'm writing some Rob notes. My account didn't ask me if I knew the creator of the project, but I am using the email that I sent to Joel last week.

UPDATE: I have not found my digital scans of my art, nor my actual art. However, I found something more rare and interesting : scans of my pencils, that I erased when I did the inks on the art. So It's good to find these.

They are TIFF graphic files from several years ago. I would like to archive these without translating them to another format. Or at least, copy them by uploading them to here. 

I haven't figured out how to do that yet.
